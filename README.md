#Coding Club Website

PSG coding club website is built using MERN stack i.e Mongo, Express, React, Node. As a team of 5, we built and managed a highly successful redesign by coordinating communications and staff training. I have played a role in designing and implementing the frontend using react. The objective of the website is to provide clear-cut information about events conducted and share the scripts and articles written by students through the website.

We have included features like students can submit their articles on the website to share them. Authentication for admin users for keeping events, articles updated and sharing the links for hackathons conducted every week
